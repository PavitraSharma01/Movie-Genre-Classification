# Movie Genre Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to classify movies into genres based on their textual descriptions (e.g., plot summaries). The goal is to preprocess the text data, convert it into numerical features, and train a classifier to predict the genre of a movie accurately. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of a machine learning workflow, including **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment**.

---

## Problem Statement
Classifying movies into genres is a challenging task, especially when relying solely on textual descriptions. Traditional methods often require manual tagging, which is time-consuming and subjective. This project automates the genre classification process using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** techniques, making it scalable and efficient.

---

## Key Features
1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Combines movie titles and descriptions into a single text feature.
   - Converts raw text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trains a **Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier** to predict movie genres.
   - Explores other classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) for comparison.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates the model using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
   - Provides insights into **feature importance** (top words associated with each genre).

4. **Deployment**:
   - Saves the trained model and vectorizer for future use.
   - Includes scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

---

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Training Data**: Contains movie IDs, titles, genres, and descriptions.
- **Test Data**: Contains movie IDs, titles, and descriptions (used for predictions).

Example:
```
ID ::: Title ::: Genre ::: Description
1 ::: The Dark Knight ::: Action ::: When the menace known as the Joker emerges...
2 ::: Inception ::: Sci-Fi ::: A thief who steals corporate secrets...
```

---

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzes the distribution of genres.
   - Checks for missing values and data quality.

2. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Combines titles and descriptions.
   - Applies **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert text into numerical features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Splits the data into training and validation sets.
   - Trains a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Generates a **classification report** and **confusion matrix**.
   - Identifies the top 10 words associated with each genre.

5. **Saving the Model**:
   - Saves the trained model (`genre_classifier.pkl`) and vectorizer (`tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`) for future use.

---

## Results
- The trained model achieves an **accuracy of X%** on the validation set.
- The most important features (words) for each genre are identified, providing insights into the model's decision-making process.

## Future Improvements
1. Experiment with **deep learning models** (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better performance.
2. Include **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.
3. Expand the dataset to include more genres and movies for better generalization.
